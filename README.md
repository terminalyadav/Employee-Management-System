- Git

### üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Employee-Management-System
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development

   # Database Configuration (MongoDB Atlas or Local)
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-username:your-password@cluster.mongodb.net/HRMS
   # OR for local MongoDB:
   # MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/HRMS

   # Session Configuration
   SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secure-session-secret-here
   SESSION_MAX_AGE=10800000

   # Authentication Configuration
   BCRYPT_ROUNDS=10

   # Application Settings
   APP_NAME=Employee Management System
   APP_VERSION=1.0.0

   # Security Settings
   COOKIE_MAX_AGE=10800000

   # Development/Debug Settings
   DEBUG=hrms:*
   ```

   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Replace the MongoDB URI with your actual database connection string and change the SESSION_SECRET to a secure random string.

### üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

**Seed the database with initial data:**
```bash
npm run seed
```

This will create default user accounts:
- **Admin**: admin@admin.com / admin123
- **Project Manager**: pm@pm.com / pm1234
- **Accounts Manager**: am@am.com / am1234
- **Employee**: anshu@gmail.com / 123456
- **Employee**: ShivamSharma@sample.com / 123456

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

**Development Mode (with auto-restart):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
npm run prod
```

**Standard Start:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Available Scripts:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Development with auto-restart
npm run dev:debug    # Development with debug logging
npm run prod         # Production mode
npm start           # Standard production start
npm run seed         # Seed database with initial data
npm run clean        # Clean install dependencies
npm run update       # Update dependencies
npm run security     # Run security audit
```

### üåê Access the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to: **http://localhost:3000**
2. Use the seeded user credentials to log in
3. The application is now ready to use!

### üîß Development

- The server runs on port 3000 by default (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- In development mode, the server automatically restarts when files change
- MongoDB connection is established automatically on startup
- Session data is stored in MongoDB for persistence

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes
